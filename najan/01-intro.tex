\section{Introduction}

Najan is an a priori, analytic, isolating conlang featuring perfectly phonemic
orthography and unambiguous syntax based on first-order logic. It is my first
and only conlang, developed for no particular purpose beyond recreation. This
document describes the major phonetic, orthographic, syntactic, and semantic
features of Najan.

My only real design goal was to create a language that I personally find
aesthetically pleasing, and simplicity, consistency, and unambiguity are
properties I like. Naturalism was a low priority, perhaps more from inability
than disinterest since I have no formal linguistic training.

For a comprehensive list of Najan words, see \emph{The Najan Lexicon}
(upcoming).
