# Causes & Conditions

An **agent** (ᴀ) is an animate, voluntary cause of an action or state. A
**patient** (ᴘ) is something that is acted upon or undergoes change as a result
of an action.

je  | ci | ko | rʊ | gi  | nʊ        | ganθ    | qa  | kwon    | tceh   | θe  | fleh
ɪɴᴅ | ᴀ  | I  | ᴘ  | the | such-that | be-sand | ɢᴇɴ | fortify | result | ᴘғᴠ | destroy
I destroyed the sand castle (intentionally).
</gloss>

In contrast to an agent, a **cause** (ᴄᴀᴜs) is involuntary. The particle {slo}
translates to _because of_.

je  | slo  | ko | rʊ | gi  | nʊ        | ganθ    | qa  | kwon    | tceh   | θe  | fleh
ɪɴᴅ | ᴄᴀᴜs | I  | ᴘ  | the | such-that | be-sand | ɢᴇɴ | fortify | result | ᴘғᴠ | destroy
The sand castle was destroyed because of me. (I destroyed the sand castle unintentionally.)
</gloss>

A cause can also be inanimate.

je  | slo  | gi  | vucul | rʊ | gi  | nʊ        | ganθ    | qa  | kwon    | tceh   | θe  | fleh
ɪɴᴅ | ᴄᴀᴜs | the | sea   | ᴘ  | the | such-that | be-sand | ɢᴇɴ | fortify | result | ᴘғᴠ | destroy
The sea destroyed the sand castle.

When the complement of a causal argument is a verb phrase, {slo} functions like
the English subordinating conjunction _because_.

The **conditional** (ᴄᴏɴᴅ) case specifies a condition or dependency required in
order for the modified expression to apply. The conditional particle {xo} most
closely translates to _depending on_.

<gloss>
xo   | gi  | mɪl    | lay | ŋɪ  | ko | rod
ᴄᴏɴᴅ | the | person | ᴄᴍs | sʙᴊ | I  | am on time
Depending on that person, I will be on time.
</gloss>

When the complement is a verb phrase, the conditional functions like the English
subordinating conjunction _if_.

<gloss>
xo   | ŋɪ  | gi  | mɪl    | rod        | lay | ŋɪ  | ko | rod
ᴄᴏɴᴅ | sʙᴊ | the | person | is on time | ᴄᴍs | sʙᴊ | I  | am on time
If that person is on time, then I will be on time.
