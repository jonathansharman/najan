# Time & Place

Najan has four prepositions for characterizing time and place:

1. {lɪ} for location at or within a point or region of space or time
2. {we} for movement to or into a point or region
3. {xu} for movement from, away from, or out of
4. {zi} for movement through, throughout, or across

Each of these prepositions is inclusive; i.e. {we} includes the destination,
{xu} includes the origin, and {zi} includes the entirety of the path, region, or
duration.

The complements of these prepositions may be explicit places or times, but they
could also be something else, such as a person or event. In the latter case, the
argument refers to the spatio-temporal location of that object; e.g. {lɪ ko}
(literally _at me_) means _at my time and place_.

English supplies a plethora of prepositions for describing spatio-temporal
relations. For instance, a chair may be at, on, under, or beside a table. In
Najan, each of these relations would use the same (locative) preposition: {za lɪ
za cats qa muð dan}, _a chair at a table_.

The preposition alone is often sufficient in context to convey the full
relationship, but to add clarity or expressiveness, one can replace the
complement of the preposition with a more specific expression. For example,
since the preposition {we} (_to_) is always inclusive of the specified
destination, {we gi vatθ} (_to the end_) means that the expression holds true up
to and including the end. To convey that the expression held true up to (but not
necessarily including) some time before the end, one could say {we za qa gi vatθ
kle}, lit. _to a past [time] of the end_.
