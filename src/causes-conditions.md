# Causes & Conditions

An **agent** ({cim}) of a verb, marked by the preposition {ci}, is its animate,
voluntary cause.

<gloss>
je  | ci | ko | ŋɪ  | gi  | nʊ   | ganθ    | qa | kwon       | tceh   | θe  | fleh
sɴs | by | me | sʙᴊ | the | that | is sand | of | fortifying | result | ᴘғᴠ | destroy
I destroyed the sand castle (intentionally).
</gloss>

In contrast to an agent, a **cause** ({slon}) is involuntary. The preposition
{slo} translates to _because of_.

<gloss>
je  | slo        | ko | ŋɪ  | gi  | nʊ   | ganθ    | qa | kwon       | tceh   | θe  | fleh
sɴs | because of | me | sʙᴊ | the | that | is sand | of | fortifying | result | ᴘғᴠ | destroy
The sand castle was destroyed because of me. (I destroyed the sand castle unintentionally.)
</gloss>

A cause can also be inanimate.

<gloss>
je  | slo        | gi  | vuc | ŋɪ  | gi  | nʊ   | ganθ    | qa | kwon       | tceh   | θe  | fleh
sɴs | because of | the | sea | sʙᴊ | the | that | is sand | of | fortifying | result | ᴘғᴠ | destroy
The sea destroyed the sand castle.

When the complement of a causal argument is a verb phrase, {slo} functions like
the English subordinating conjunction _because_.

The **causal-final** (ғɪɴ) preposition {tce} identifies a final cause: a
purpose, outcome, or product of some state. It can translate to _for_ or _so
that_. A final cause may be a verb phrase or noun phrase.

<gloss>
je  | tce | txa | qex    | hon | hɪm
sɴs | so  | not | hunger | ɢɴᴏ | eat
One eats so that one doesn't hunger.
</gloss>

The **conditional** preposition {xo} specifies a condition or dependency
required in order for the modified expression to apply. It most closely
translates to _depending on_.

<gloss>
xo   | gi  | mɪl    | lay | ŋɪ  | ko | rod
ᴄᴏɴᴅ | the | person | ᴄᴍs | sʙᴊ | I  | am on time
Depending on that person, I will be on time.
</gloss>

When the complement is a verb phrase, the conditional functions like the English
subordinating conjunction _if_.

<gloss>
xo   | ŋɪ  | gi  | mɪl    | rod        | lay | ŋɪ  | ko | rod
ᴄᴏɴᴅ | sʙᴊ | the | person | is on time | ᴄᴍs | sʙᴊ | I  | am on time
If that person is on time, then I will be on time.
