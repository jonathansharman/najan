## Quotation

A quotation begins and ends with the particle {tca} and functions as a noun
signifying the contained words themselves. The particle {tsa} is used within a
quotation just before {tca} or another {tsa} to indicate that the second
particle should be interpreted as part of the quotation, not as a particle
within the sentence containing the quotation.

> **Note:** Determiner phrases within quotations cannot affect the bindings of
surrounding pronouns. Assignable pronouns contained in a quotation may have
completely different referents than in the surrounding contextâ€”or even none at
all, when using a quotation to talk about the pronouns themselves.
