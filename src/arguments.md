# Arguments

Arguments to a verb are expressed as optional [prepositional
phrases](./prepositional-phrases.md). As a result, arguments have no fixed
order, and a single verb can take multiple arguments of the same semantic role.

In the following, _you_ and _I_ are both eating the same fruit:

<gloss>
je  | qa | ko | qa | to  | ŋɪ  | za | blʊθ  | tcet
sɴs | by | me | by | you | sʙᴊ | an | fruit | is eaten
You and I are eating a fruit.
</gloss>

Reversing the order of the arguments usually does not affect the meaning:

<gloss>
je  | ŋɪ  | za | blʊθ  | qa | ko | qa | to  | tcet
sɴs | sʙᴊ | an | fruit | by | me | by | you | is eaten
A fruit is being eaten by you and me.
</gloss>

However, sometimes order does matter, for instance when [universal and
existential quantification](./determiner-phrases.md#ordering-determiner-phrases)
are involved.

In the next example, the ball and glove are thrown as part of the same action:

<gloss>
je  | ŋɪ  | gi  | ðaz  | ŋɪ  | gi  | xopf  | ci | ko | θe  | wis
sɴs | sʙᴊ | the | ball | sʙᴊ | the | glove | ᴀ  | I  | ᴘғᴠ | throw
I threw the ball and glove.
</gloss>

Since arguments are simply modifiers, they are not syntactically required and
may be omitted if they can be inferred from context. When asked who I am, I
could reply:

<gloss>
je  | ŋɪ  | ko | djanʊθʊn
sɴs | sʙᴊ | I  | Jonathan
I am Jonathan.
</gloss>

Or, since _I_ is the expected subject:

<gloss>
je  | djanʊθʊn
sɴs | Jonathan
[I] am Jonathan.
</gloss>
