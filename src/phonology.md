[^1]: Specifically, labial-velar

Consonant clusters with a single point of articulation are geminated. For
instance, a word-final {k} followed by a word-initial {g} would be pronounced
\[kːg\] (note the lack of the usual aspiration) since both are velar. In
contrast, the ⟨k⟩ in ⟨-k t-⟩ is aspirated since ⟨t⟩ is alveolar.

A plosive-fricative cluster with a single point of articulation becomes an
affricate. {t} and {d}, which normally denote alveolar plosives, shift their
point of articulation before dental or post-alveolar fricatives to assimilate
with the fricative.

The clusters {tl} and {dl} become the lateral affricates \[t͡ɬ\] and \[d͡ɮ\],
respectively. Similarly, in some dialects, {sl} and {zl} become the lateral
fricatives \[ɬ\] and \[ɮ\].

## Phonotactics

Najan is monosyllabic, with C(C)V(C)(C) structure. Within an onset or coda, any
plosives, fricatives, and taps must all be voiced or all be voiceless. For
example, ⟨ts-⟩ and ⟨tl-⟩ are valid, but ⟨tz-⟩ is not.

| First consonant | Optional second consonant            |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| plosive         | fricative[^2], liquid, tap, or glide |
| fricative       | liquid, tap, or glide                |
| nasal           | glide                                |

| glide           |                                      |

<div class="caption">Coda</div>

| Optional first consonant | Optional second consonant                 |
| :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| plosive                  | fricative[^2]                             |
| fricative                | plosive[^2]                               |
| nasal                    | plosive with same point of articulation   |
| liquid                   | plosive, fricative, or nasal              |
| tap                      |                                           |
| glide                    | plosive, fricative, nasal, liquid, or tap |

[^2]:
    Plosive-fricative and fricative-plosive clusters never combine a velar
    fricative with a non-velar plosive.

## Stress

Najan uses a stress accent system, with stressed words receiving greater volume,
a longer vowel, and higher tone. Najan is also stress-timed, with stressed words
occurring at relatively constant intervals. Typically, verbs are stressed and
particles unstressed, except for emphasis.
