# Modality

Every clause in Najan begins with one to two particles expressing that clause's
modality, how the clause relates to the world or to other possible worlds. The
first particle is required and establishes the clause's basic **mood**.

The second, optional particle conveys the clause's **epistemtic mood**, a
refinement of the mood that specifies the degree of certainty associated with
the clause.

| Epistemic Mood  | Gloss | Particle |
| :-------------- | :---- | :------- |
| Dubitative      | ᴅᴜʙ   | {dze}    |
| Speculative     | sᴘᴇᴄ  | {glu}    |
| Probabilitative | ᴘʀᴏʙ  | {kis}    |
| Assertive       | ᴀss   | ---      |
| Certaintative   | ᴄᴇʀᴛ  | {bji}    |

The following paragraphs outline how the epistemic moods interact with the
indicative moods, to give a general sense of their semantics. Note however that
the semantics differ somewhat when combined with other mood categories.

The **dubatative epistemic mood** (ᴅᴜʙ) indicates that there's some evidence for
the claim, but the speaker disbelieves it or at least has doubts about it. This
mood has a similar connotation to *purportedly*, *supposedly*, etc.

The **speculative epistemic mood** (sᴘᴇᴄ) conveys that the claim is merely
possible; it may have some supporting evidence but not enough to deem it likely.

The **probabilitative epistemic mood** (ᴘʀᴏʙ) is for claims that the speaker
deems most likely true but without firm conviction.

The **assertive epistemic mood** (ᴀss) is the default when no epistemic particle
is given and simply means the speaker holds the claim to be true.

The **certaintative epistemic mood** (ᴄᴇʀᴛ) means the speaker is unreservedly
convinced. The omission of this marker does not necessarily indicate a degree of
doubt. Rather, its inclusion serves as emphatic assurance when the audience
might otherwise hold some doubt. One wouldn't typically bother using this marker
for uncontroversial, commonplace claims, even if the degree of certainty is
high.

## Indicative Moods

The indicative moods are used to make a claim about how the world actually is.
These moods are distinguished by evidentiality, i.e. the speaker's source of
information supporting the claim.

The **sensory mood** (sɴs) is for claims supported by the speaker's own direct
sensory experience or intuition.

The **deductive mood** (ᴅᴇᴅ) is for conclusions the speaker has deduced
rationally from other accepted evidence. The conclusion could be based on sense
data, hearsay, or other inferences, as long as the conclusion itself comes from
the speaker's own reasoning. Use of the deductive mood doesn't imply that the
speaker has consciously constructed a formal logical proof for their claim, but
it should imply that they believe they could sketch a convincing informal
argument on request. Hunches should be expressed using the sensory mood, not the
deductive.

The **reportative mood** (ʀᴘʀᴛ) is for claims originating from someone other
than the speaker, such as something the speaker has heard or read.

The choice of indicative particle by itself has no bearing on how strongly the
speaker believes the claim. For instance, it's entirely possible to be more
convinced of a reportative statement originating from a highly reliable and
authoritative source than of a sensory statement based on a vague feeling or
unclear view. The speaker may convey how strongly they believe their own
statement using an epistemic mood particle.

## Interrogative Moods

The interrogative moods are for asking different types of questions.

A **content question** (ᴄᴏ̨) requests missing information using the
[interrogative pronoun](./pronouns.md) {vel}. The response should supply the
missing information that would make the complete clause true. To this
question...

<gloss>
gwɪ | ŋɪ  | vel  | qa  | to  | kʊv
ᴄᴏ̨  | sʙᴊ | what | ɢᴇɴ | you | names
What names you? (What is your name?)
</gloss>

...I could respond {je djan} (*It's Jon*).

Informally, one can omit {vel}, if it's apparent what's being asked: {gwi kʊv}
(*Name?*).

A content question may request multiple pieces of information.

<gloss>
gwɪ | tce | vel  | ci | vel | θe  | pɪn
ᴄᴏ̨  | ғɪɴ | what | ᴀ  | who | ᴘғᴠ | do
Who did what?
</gloss>

This questioner has asked for two pieces of information here: who did it and
what they did. Note that {vel} is a pronoun, so it can't stand in for a verb
directly. However, using {pɪn} (*do*) as the verb allows asking about actions,
by using {vel} as a causal-final argument.

A **polar question** (ᴘᴏ̨) prompts for a yes-or-no answer, confirming or denying
the clause.

<gloss>
ner | ci | to     | vɪg
ᴘᴏ̨  | ᴀ  | you-sɢ | go
Are you going?
</gloss>

The reponse can usually be very brief, e.g. {je ksi} (*it's true*) or {je gle}
(*it's false*).

An **alternative question** (ᴀᴏ̨) should pose a series of mutually exclusive
options, only one of which makes the overall clause true. Typically this
involves an exclusive logical disjunction. It's possible but very uncommon for
an alternative question to contain multiple sets of options, prompting multiple
selections from the respondent. A question with two opposite possibilities would
typically be expressed as a polar question but could be expressed as an
alternative question for emphassis: *are you or are you not my people?*

Any question may be predicated on faulty premises, whether implicit or explicit.
In that case, the respondent may choose to contradict these assumptions rather
than answer the question on its own terms.

### Interrogative Epistemic Mood

The epistemic mood of a question indicates the asker's degree of confidence in
the underlying proposition. In the case of content or alternative questions,
this refers to the proposition after the respondent has filled in the blanks.

<gloss>
gwɪ | bji  | bo  | ŋak    | vel   | θe  | pɪn
ᴄᴏ̨  | ᴄᴇʀᴛ | ᴘᴛᴠ | you-ᴘʟ | which | ᴘғᴠ | do
Which of you did it? (I know it was one of you!)
</gloss>

Polar questions often specify the epistemic mood for rhetorical effect or to
function similarly to a tag question.

## Deontic Moods

The deontic moods are for asserting how the world shall be or ought to be.

The **commissive mood** (ᴄᴍs) indicates that the speaker intends to bring about
the clause so that in the future it will be become or remain true.

The **imperative mood** (ɪᴍᴘᴇʀ) expresses a request or command for the listener
to make or keep the clause true.

The **volitive mood** (ᴠᴏʟ) expresses a wish or desire of the speaker. Unlike
the commissive or imperative moods, it does not imply that the speaker or
listener is responsible for actualizing that wish.

### Deontic Epistemic Mood

The epistemic mood of a deontic clause indicates how likely the speaker thinks
the clause is to become or remain true. For a commissive clause, this factors in
the speaker's own commitment to following through on the promise. For an
imperative clause, it factors in the listener's willingness to carry out the
request or command, as perceived by the speaker. Thus an epistemic mood particle
can serve to weaken or strengthen a promise or command. For instance, a
dubitative imperative clause could express a very polite request, whereas a
certaintative imperative could be an urgent command or exhortation.
