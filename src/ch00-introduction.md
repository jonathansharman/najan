# Introduction

This book describes the major phonological, orthographic, syntactic, and
semantic properties of Najan, my first and so far only conlang. Najan is an *a
priori*, analytic, isolating conlang featuring perfectly phonemic orthography,
an unambiguous context-free grammar, and pronoun binding and quantification
rules inspired by first-order logic. The Najan name for Najan is <naj>kʊv naj
vɪx</naj> [kʰʊv näʒ vɪɾ̥ʰ].

I have no formal linguistic training, so the language is not very naturalistic
or elaborate as far as conlangs go. Nevertheless, it's been a joy to work on,
and I'm happy with how it has evolved and am excited to share it with others.

*Soli Deo gloria.*
