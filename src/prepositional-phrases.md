# Prepositional Phrases

A prepositional phrase comprises a preposition and its noun phrase complement,
assigning that complement some semantic role within the clause or verb phrase
that the prepositional phrase modifies.

Prepositions are derived from corresponding verbs by clipping. For example, the
preposition {ci} marks its object as an agent and is derived from the verb
{cim}, _agent_.
