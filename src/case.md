# Case

Najan marks case using prepositions, in both prepositional phrases acting as
[arguments](./arguments.md) to a verb and in [stativized verb
phrases](./stativization.md) using the particle {vʊ}.

| Case         | Gloss | Preposition |
| :----------- | :---- | :---------- |
| Subjective   | sʙᴊ   | {ŋɪ}        |
| Objective    | ᴏʙᴊ   | {qa}        |
| Agentive     | ᴀ     | {ci}        |
| Causal       | ᴄᴀᴜs  | {slo}       |
| Patientive   | ᴘ     | {rʊ}        |
| Instrumental | ɪɴs   | {θla}       |
| Dative       | ᴅᴀᴛ   | {ðu}        |
| Locative     | ʟᴏᴄ   | {lɪ}        |
| Resultative  | ʀᴇs   | {tce}       |
| Identical    | ɪᴅᴇɴᴛ | {kʊv}       |
| Comparative  | ᴄᴍᴘʀ  | {kɪ}        |

Within a stative verb phrase, a **subject** (sʙᴊ) is something that is in the
state described by the verb, and an **object** (ᴏʙᴊ) is a catch-all argument
that relates to the subject according to the particular semantics of the verb.
The objective preposition {qa} could be translated as "with respect to".

<gloss>
je  | qa  | to  | ŋɪ  | ko | gwi
ɪɴᴅ | ᴏʙᴊ | you | sʙᴊ | I  | be-behind
I am behind you.
</gloss>

TODO: two-subject example, e.g. this equals that (this and that are both subjects)

An **agent** (ᴀ) of a dynamic verb phrase is an animate, voluntary cause of the
action. A **patient** (ᴘ) is something that is acted upon or undergoes change as
a result of the action.

<gloss>
je  | ci | ko | rʊ | gi  | nʊ        | ganθ    | vʊ   | tce  | kwon    | θe   | fleh
ɪɴᴅ | ᴀ  | I  | ᴘ  | the | such-that | be-sand | sᴛᴀᴛ | ʀᴇs  | fortify | ᴘғᴠ  | destroy
I destroyed the sand castle (intentionally).
</gloss>

In contrast to an agent, a **cause** (ᴄᴀᴜs) is involuntary.

<gloss>
je  | slo  | ko | rʊ | gi  | nʊ        | ganθ    | vʊ   | tce | kwon    | θe  | fleh
ɪɴᴅ | ᴄᴀᴜs | I  | ᴘ  | the | such-that | be-sand | sᴛᴀᴛ | ʀᴇs | fortify | ᴘғᴠ | destroy
I destroyed the sand castle (unintentionally).
</gloss>

A cause can also be inanimate.

<gloss>
je  | slo  | gi  | vucul | rʊ | gi  | nʊ        | ganθ    | vʊ   | tce | kwon    | θe  | fleh
ɪɴᴅ | ᴄᴀᴜs | the | sea   | ᴘ  | the | such-that | be-sand | sᴛᴀᴛ | ʀᴇs | fortify | ᴘғᴠ | destroy
The sea destroyed the sand castle.
</gloss>

A **comparison** (ᴄᴍᴘʀ) is something the verb is similar to. The comparative
particle {kɪ} often translates to "as", "like", or "in the manner of".

<gloss>
hon | kɪ   | lec   | pɪf
ɢɴᴏ | ᴄᴍᴘʀ | water | soothe
[It] soothes like water.
