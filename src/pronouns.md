# Pronouns

Najan has two first-person plural pronouns, distinguished by clusivity. The
inclusive pronoun {djof} includes the speaker, those addressed, and possibly
one or more third-person referents. The exclusive pronoun {jal} includes the
speaker and at least one third person but excludes those addressed.

The interrogative pronoun {velk} stands for something unknown and is essential
to the formation of interrogative sentences, where it indicates any missing
information that the asker wishes to know.

## Assignable Pronouns

The assignable pronouns {jow}, {með}, {paw}, and {tsut} have no fixed
properties, such as person, number, or gender. They can be bound (or rebound) to
any unquantified noun phrase, using determiners.

The next section explains the function of the determiners, including the meaning
and scope of any pronouns they bind.
