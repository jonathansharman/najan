inclusive pronoun {djof} includes the speaker, those addressed, and possibly
one or more third-person referents. The exclusive pronoun {jal} includes the

The interrogative pronoun {vel} stands for something unknown and is essential to
the formation of [content questions](./modality.md#interrogative-moods), where
it indicates the missing information that the asker wishes to know.

The assignable pronouns {jow}, {með}, {paŋ}, and {tsut} have no fixed
properties, such as person, number, or gender. They can be bound (or rebound) to
any unquantified noun phrase, via determiner phrases.
