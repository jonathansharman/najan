# Phonology

Stress falls on the first syllable of a word. However, stress never
distinguishes words and can be altered for emphasis. Najan is stress-timed.

[^1]: Specifically, labial-velar

Across word boundaries, consonants with the same point of articulation are
geminated. For instance, a word-final {k} followed by a word-initial {g} would
be pronounced \[k:g\] (note the lack of the usual aspiration) since both are
velar. In contrast, the ⟨k⟩ in ⟨-k t-⟩ is aspirated since ⟨t⟩ is alveolar.

Within a word, a plosive-fricative cluster with a single point of articulation
becomes an affricate. {t} and {d}, which normally denote alveolar plosives,
shift their point of articulation before dental or post-alveolar fricatives to
align with the fricative.

The clusters {tl} and {dl} become the lateral affricates \[t͡ɬ\] and \[d͡ɮ\],
respectively. Similarly, but only in some dialects, {sl} and {zl} become the
lateral fricatives \[ɬ\] and \[ɮ\].
