# Determiner Phrases

A **determiner phrase** consists of a determiner, an optional pronoun to bind,
and a stative verb phrase complement. The phrase signifies some entity such that
the complement holds true with that entity as the subject. Najan has just three
determiners:

| Determiner | Type         | Translation    |
| :--------- | :----------- | :------------- |
| {za}       | Indefinite   | "a"/"an"       |
| {gi}       | Definite     | "the"          |
| {su}       | Distributive | "each"/"every" |

The **indefinite determiner** {za} introduces a new instance of the complement.
It corresponds to existential quantification in logic.

<gloss>
za | tab
a  | be-father
a father
</gloss>

The **definite determiner** {gi} refers to a known instance of the complement.
The referent should be unique (e.g. a proper noun) or otherwise obvious from
context. There is only one entity that is the sun:

<gloss>
je  | ci | gi  | θxɪl   | fiq
ɪɴᴅ | ᴀ  | the | be-sun | shine
The sun is shining.
</gloss>

We can express a demonstrative ("this" or "that") by modifying the complement of
a definite determiner with {nʊ tlɪ} ("here") or {nʊ dwa} ("there").

The **distributive determiner** {su} expresses that the clauses containing the
determiner phrase (and its pronoun, if any) hold true for each instance of the
complement. It corresponds to universal quantification in logic.

<gloss>
je  | rʊ | su   | vɪx      | fxe | cay
ɪɴᴅ | ᴘ  | each | language | ʜᴀʙ | change
Every language changes.
</gloss>

## Pronoun Binding

Binding a pronoun in a determiner phrase allows referring back to it in a
concise and unambiguous way.

<gloss>
je  | ci | gi  | paŋ | dzað     | rʊ | paŋ | θe  | khɪtc
ɪɴᴅ | ᴀ  | the | it  | be-child | ᴘ  | it  | ᴘғᴠ | hurt
The child hurt itself.
</gloss>

## Ordering Determiner Phrases

We have to be careful about the order of [arguments](./arguments.md) when
distributive determiners and indefinite determiners are both present since they
are not commutative with each other.

It's true that every human has a human mother:

<gloss>
je  | qa  | su   | ðap   | ŋɪ  | za | ðap   | θaf
ɪɴᴅ | ᴏʙᴊ | each | human | sʙᴊ | a  | human | be-mother
Every human is mothered by a human.
</gloss>

It is however not true that all humans share a single universal mother:

<gloss>
je  | ŋɪ  | za | ðap   | qa  | su   | ðap   | θaf
ɪɴᴅ | sʙᴊ | a  | human | ᴏʙᴊ | each | human | be-mother
[There exists] a human [that] is mother to every human.
</gloss>
