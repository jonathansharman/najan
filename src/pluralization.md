# Pluralization

A stative verb phrase can be pluralized by preceding it with the particle {ma}.
Precisely, {ma} followed by a state means to be a set of entities that are all
in that state. This set may contain any number of elements, including zero or
one.

Unlike plurals in English, instantiating the {ma} plural form requires the use
of a [determiner](./determiner-phrases.md). The following attempted translation
of _I hear people over there_ is incorrect (and nonsensical):

<gloss>
je  | ŋɪ  | ko | qa  | nʊ   | dwa     | ma | mɪl    | noy
ɪɴᴅ | sʙᴊ | I  | ɢᴇɴ | that | distant | ᴘʟ | person | hear
I hear to be distant people.
</gloss>

Adding the indefinite determiner gives the intended meaning:

<gloss>
je  | ŋɪ  | ko | qa  | za   | nʊ   | dwa     | ma | mɪl    | noy
ɪɴᴅ | sʙᴊ | I  | ɢᴇɴ | some | that | distant | ᴘʟ | person | hear
I hear people over there. (I hear some people that are distant.)
</gloss>
