# Subjects & Relations

Most prepositional phrases---and the verb arguments they express---have
relatively fixed definitions, so if one knows the meaning of a verb, then the
meaning of its arguments follows straightforwardly. Two semantic roles are
exceptions to this pattern of predictability: the **subject** ({ŋɪθ}) and
**relation** ({qac}). These roles are essential components of the semantics of
each verb.

Every Najan verb describes some state of being. The subject of a verb, marked
using the preposition {ŋɪ}, denotes the entity that is in that state. (It can be
very difficult to provide a good gloss for this preposition since in English the
subject is positional. Therefore, I will generally gloss {ŋɪ} as just "sʙᴊ".)

Many verbs also permit a secondary relational argument, marked using {qa}, which
most often means something like _of_, _with respect to_, _with regard to_, or
_in relation to_.

For example, in the verb {zim} (_want_), the subject is the one who is
experiencing desire, and the relation is that which is wanted.

<gloss>
je  | qa | ŋɪ  | ko | ŋɪθ   | ŋɪ  | ko | zim
sɴs | of | sʙᴊ | I  | exist | sʙᴊ | I  | want
I want to exist. (I want that I exist.)
</gloss>

For a given Najan verb, the meanings of {ŋɪ} and {qa} may or may not align well
with the subject and object of a similar English verb. As a general rule, the
entity most strongly pertaining to or affected by the verb will be defined as
its subject. Taking for example the verb {tcet} (_be eaten_), the subject is the
thing consumed, and the relational argument is the consumer. These roles are
exactly reversed for the related word {hɪm}, _eat_.
