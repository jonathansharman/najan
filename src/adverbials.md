# Adverbials

The **restrictive modifier** {nʊ} (_such that_) takes a verb phrase as its
complement and restricts its head such that the complement is true. If the
complement is a stative verb phrase with no explicit subject, the subject is
assumed to be the head of the prepositional phrase.

<gloss>
gi  | nʊ        | tir     | ŋix
the | such that | is good | dog
the good dog
</gloss>

Here, {nʊ tir} helps define the entity the speaker is referring to: one
belonging to the set of excellent dogs. Perhaps there are also some not so good
dogs under consideration, and the speaker wishes to specify the best one.

The **nonrestrictive modifier** {vew} (_which_) also takes a stative verb
phrase, but this state merely describes the head, rather than defining it.

<gloss>
gi  | vew   | tir     | ŋix
the | which | is good | dog
the dog, which is good
</gloss>

Here, {vew tir} implies that all dogs are good.

Note that in English, the terms _such that_ and _which_ are normally analyzed as
subordinating conjunctions. However, in Najan, conjunctions are restricted to
logical operations, and the terms {nʊ} and {vew} are analyzed as adverbial
prepositions.
