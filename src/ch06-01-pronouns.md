# Pronouns

Najan has two first-person plural pronouns, distinguished by clusivity. The
inclusive pronoun <naj>djof</naj> ⟨djof⟩ includes the speaker, those addressed,
and possibly one or more third-person referents. The exclusive pronoun
<naj>jal</naj> ⟨jal⟩ includes the speaker and at least one third person but
excludes those addressed.

The interrogative pronoun <naj>velk</naj> ⟨velk⟩ stands for something unknown
and is essential to the formation of interrogative sentences, where it indicates
any missing information that the asker wishes to know.

## Assignable Pronouns

The assignable pronouns <naj>jow</naj> ⟨jow⟩, <naj>með</naj> ⟨með⟩,
<naj>paw</naj> ⟨paw⟩, and <naj>tsut</naj> ⟨tsut⟩ have no fixed properties, such
as person, number, or gender. They can be bound (or rebound) to any unquantified
noun phrase, using determiners.

The next section explains the function of the determiners, including the meaning
and scope of any pronouns they bind.
