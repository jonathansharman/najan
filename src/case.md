# Case

Each Najan case corresponds to a particular semantic role within the verb
phrase, marked using a preposition. These case prepositions are clipped from
corresponding stative verbs. For example, since {cim} means *agent*, the
corresponding case preposition {ci} marks the agentive case.

Within a stative verb phrase, a **subject** (sʙᴊ) is something that is in that
state. Many stative verb phrases also permit a genitive (ɢᴇɴ) argument, which
relates that argument to the subject according to the particular semantics of
the verb. The genitive preposition {qa} means "with respect to", "with regard
to", or "in relation to".

<gloss>
je  | qa  | ŋɪ  | ko | ŋɪθ   | ŋɪ  | ko | zim
ɪɴᴅ | ɢᴇɴ | sʙᴊ | I  | exist | sʙᴊ | I  | want
I want to exist. (I want that I exist.)
</gloss>

An **agent** (ᴀ) of a dynamic verb phrase is an animate, voluntary cause of the
action. A **patient** (ᴘ) is something that is acted upon or undergoes change as
a result of the action.

<gloss>
je  | ci | ko | rʊ | gi  | nʊ        | ganθ    | vʊ   | tce  | kwon    | θe   | fleh
ɪɴᴅ | ᴀ  | I  | ᴘ  | the | such-that | be-sand | sᴛᴀᴛ | ʀᴇs  | fortify | ᴘғᴠ  | destroy
I destroyed the sand castle (intentionally).
</gloss>

In contrast to an agent, a **cause** (ᴄᴀᴜs) is involuntary.

<gloss>
je  | slo  | ko | rʊ | gi  | nʊ        | ganθ    | vʊ   | tce | kwon    | θe  | fleh
ɪɴᴅ | ᴄᴀᴜs | I  | ᴘ  | the | such-that | be-sand | sᴛᴀᴛ | ʀᴇs | fortify | ᴘғᴠ | destroy
I destroyed the sand castle (unintentionally).
</gloss>

A cause can also be inanimate.

<gloss>
je  | slo  | gi  | vucul | rʊ | gi  | nʊ        | ganθ    | vʊ   | tce | kwon    | θe  | fleh
ɪɴᴅ | ᴄᴀᴜs | the | sea   | ᴘ  | the | such-that | be-sand | sᴛᴀᴛ | ʀᴇs | fortify | ᴘғᴠ | destroy
The sea destroyed the sand castle.
</gloss>

The **lative** (ʟᴀᴛ) case is used for any kind of action to or towards
something, in space or time.

<gloss>
je  | we   | to  | ci | ko | θe  | zen
ɪɴᴅ | ʟᴀᴛ  | you | ᴀ  | I  | ᴘғᴠ | give
I gave [it] to you.
</gloss>

The **semblative** (sᴇᴍʙʟ) case marks something the verb is similar to. The
semblative particle {kɪ} means "as", "like", or "in the manner of".

<gloss>
hon | kɪ    | ðu  | lec   | pɪf
ɢɴᴏ | sᴇᴍʙʟ | ɢɴʀ | water | soothe
[It] soothes like water.
</gloss>
