# Binding

Any verb phrase can also function as a noun phrase, signifying an abstract state
or action (e.g. "being human", "running", "love"). To talk about concrete
instances, sets, or amounts of something (e.g. "you", "the victory", "two dogs",
"some water", "several words"), one can use pronouns or determiner phrases.
Determiner phrases can optionally bind the referent or referents to an
assignable pronoun, with different binding semantics depending on the determiner
used.

> **Note:** Determiner phrases within quotations cannot affect the bindings of
surrounding pronouns. Assignable pronouns contained in a quotation may have
completely different referents than in the surrounding contextâ€”or even none at
all, when using a quotation to talk about the pronouns themselves.

This chapter explains the function of Najan pronouns and determiners and how the
two interact via determiner phrases.
