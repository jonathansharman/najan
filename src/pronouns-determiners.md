# Pronouns & Determiners

Any verb phrase can also function as a noun phrase, signifying an abstract state
or action (e.g. "being human", "running", "love"). To talk about concrete
instances, sets, or amounts of something (e.g. "you", "the victory", "two dogs",
"some water", "several words"), one can use pronouns or determiner phrases.
Determiner phrases can optionally bind the referent or referents to an
assignable pronoun, with different binding semantics depending on the determiner
used.

This section explains the function of Najan pronouns and determiners and how the
two interact via determiner phrases.
