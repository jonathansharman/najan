# Relative Clauses

A relative clause modifies a verb phrase, noun phrase, or clause using a verb
phrase complement whose implicit subject is the modified head.

A **restrictive clause**, beginning with {nʊ} (_that_), restricts its head to
only those instances where the verb phrase complement is true (again, using the
head as the subject).

<gloss>
gi  | nʊ   | tir     | ŋix
the | that | is good | dog
the good dog
</gloss>

Here, the relative clause {nʊ tir} helps define the entity the speaker is
referring to: one belonging to the set of excellent dogs. Perhaps there are also
some not so good dogs under consideration. The use of the restrictive clause
rules these dogs out as referents of this noun phrase.

A **non-restrictive clause**, beginning with {vew} (_which_), provides
additional information about the head but does not narrow down the set of
possible referents. In other words, it describes the head without defining it.

<gloss>
gi  | vew   | tir     | ŋix
the | which | is good | dog
the dog (dogs are good)
</gloss>

Here, {vew tir} asserts that all dogs are good. We could remove the
non-restrictive modifier entirely, and the meaning of {gi ŋix} would not change.

Restricted noun phrases, such as determiner phrases and pronouns, cannot be
further modified by restrictive clauses or prepositional phrases. For instance,
{nʊ tayn ko} (_happy I_) is ungrammatical. Conversely, non-restrictive clauses
can modify restricted noun phrases.

<gloss>
vew   | tir     | gi  | ŋix
which | is good | the | dog
the dog, which is good
</gloss>

In this example, {vew tir} does not contribute to the identification of the dog,
nor does it describe dogs in general. It provides extra information about a
particular dog that has already been identified.
