# Arguments

Arguments to a verb are expressed as [case-marking](./case.md) prepositional
phrases modifying the verb. As a result, arguments have no fixed order, and a
single verb can take multiple arguments of the same semantic role.

In the following, "you" and "I" are joint agents of the eating of a single
orange:

<gloss>
je  | ci | ko | ci | to  | rʊ | za | rabʊm  | tcet
ɪɴᴅ | ᴀ  | I  | ᴀ  | you | ᴘ  | an | orange | eat
You and I are eating an orange.
</gloss>

We can usually reverse the order of the arguments without affecting the meaning:

<gloss>
je  | rʊ | za | rabʊm  | ci | ko | ci | to  | tcet
ɪɴᴅ | ᴘ  | an | orange | ᴀ  | I  | ᴀ  | you | eat
An orange is being eaten by you and me.
</gloss>

However, sometimes order does matter, for instance when [universal and
existential quantification](./determiner-phrases.md) are involved.

In this example, the ball and glove are thrown as part of the same action:

<gloss>
je  | rʊ | gi  | ðaz  | rʊ | gi  | xovneθ | ci | ko | θe  | wis
ɪɴᴅ | ᴘ  | the | ball | ᴘ  | the | glove  | ᴀ  | I  | ᴘғᴠ | throw
I threw the ball and glove.
</gloss>

Since arguments are simply modifiers, they are not syntactically required and
may be omitted if they can be inferred from context. When asked who I am, I
could reply:

<gloss>
je  | ŋɪ  | ko | djanʊθʊn
ɪɴᴅ | sʙᴊ | I  | Jonathan
I am Jonathan.
</gloss>

Or, since "I" is the expected subject:

<gloss>
je  | djanʊθʊn
ɪɴᴅ | Jonathan
[I] am Jonathan.
</gloss>
