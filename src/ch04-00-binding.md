# Binding

A noun phrase in Najan can be unquantified or quantified. Unquantified noun
phrases can be modified with a prepositional phrase and signify something in the
abstract (e.g. "being human", "running", "love"). Quantified noun phrases cannot
be modified and signify a concrete instance, set, or amount of something (e.g.
"you", "the victory", "two dogs", "some water", "several words").

A quantified noun phrase can be a pronoun, quotation, or determiner phrase.
Determiner phrases can optionally bind the referent or referents to one or more
assignable pronouns, with different binding semantics depending on the
determiner.

This chapter will explain the function of Najan pronouns and determiners and how
the two interact via binding expressions.
