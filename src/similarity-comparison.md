# Similarity & Comparison

The **semblative** (sᴇᴍʙʟ) preposition marks something the complement is similar
to. The semblative particle {kɪ} means _as_, _like_, or _in the manner of_.

<gloss>
hon | kɪ | ðu  | lec   | pɪf
ɢɴᴏ | as | ɢɴʀ | water | soothe
[It] soothes like water.
</gloss>

The **comparative** (ᴄᴏᴍᴘ) preposition marks a point of comparison or reference
within a verb phrase of degree.

<gloss>
je  | ve   | to  | ŋɪ  | ko | ruθ
sɴs | than | you | sʙᴊ | I  | small
I am smaller than you. (I am small in comparison to you.)
</gloss>

The comparative particle {ve} means roughly _than_ or _in comparison to_, but
unlike these English terms, the comparison is always against the subject of the
verb. This avoids ambiguous comparisons such as _I like cheesecake more than
you_---_more than you like cheesecake_ or _more than I like you_?

A comparative argument can be combined with the [distributive
determiner](./determiner-phrases.md) {su} to form a superlative:

<gloss>
je  | ve   | su   | tez   | ŋɪ  | ko | ruθ
sɴs | ᴄᴏᴍᴘ | each | other | sʙᴊ | I  | small
I am the smallest. (I am small in comparison to all others.)
