# Determiner Phrases

A **determiner phrase** consists of a determiner, an optional pronoun to bind,
and a stative verb phrase complement. The phrase signifies some entity such that
the complement holds true with that entity as the subject. Najan has just four
determiners:

| Determiner | Type         | Translation    |
| :--------- | :----------- | :------------- |
| {za}       | Indefinite   | "a"/"an"       |
| {gi}       | Definite     | "the"          |
| {su}       | Distributive | "each"/"every" |
| {ðu}       | Generic      | "in general"   |

The **indefinite determiner** {za} introduces a new specific instance of the
complement. It corresponds to existential quantification in logic.

<gloss>
je  | qa  | za | lak  | cɪŋ
ɪɴᴅ | ɢᴇɴ | a  | bird | see
A bird is seen.
</gloss>

The **definite determiner** {gi} refers to a known instance of the complement.
The referent should be unique (e.g. a proper noun) or otherwise obvious from
context. There is only one entity that is the sun:

<gloss>
je  | ci | gi  | θxɪl | fiq
ɪɴᴅ | ᴀ  | the | sun  | shine
The sun is shining.
</gloss>

We can express a demonstrative ("this" or "that") by modifying the complement of
a definite determiner with {nʊ tlɪ} ("here") or {nʊ dwa} ("there").

The **distributive determiner** {su} expresses that the clauses containing the
determiner phrase (and its pronoun, if any) hold true for each instance of the
complement. It corresponds to universal quantification in logic.

<gloss>
je  | rʊ | su   | vɪx      | fxe | cay
ɪɴᴅ | ᴘ  | each | language | ʜᴀʙ | change
Every language changes.
</gloss>

The **generic determiner** {ðu} refers to the complement in a general,
nonspecific sense. It's often used with the [gnomic aspect](./tense-aspect).
This determiner doesn't map cleanly to any one determiner in English; for
instance, "a man's gotta eat", "cats are cute", and "the giraffe is an African
species" all have a generic subject.

<gloss>
je  | ŋɪ  | ko | ðu  | dwav | kem
ɪɴᴅ | sʙᴊ | I  | ɢɴʀ | book | like
I like books.
</gloss>

In English, the indefinite articles "a" and "an" do not encode specificity. For
instance, "I'm looking for a book" could mean I have or don't have a specific
book in mind. In Najan, the indefinite determiner is always specific:

<gloss>
je  | ŋɪ  | ko | za | dwav | moθ
ɪɴᴅ | sʙᴊ | I  | a  | book | need
I need a (particular) book.
</gloss>

The generic determiner is always nonspecific.

<gloss>
je  | ŋɪ  | ko | ðu  | dwav | moθ
ɪɴᴅ | sʙᴊ | I  | ɢɴʀ | book | need
I need a book (any book).
</gloss>

## Pronoun Binding

Binding a pronoun in a determiner phrase allows referring back to it in a
concise and unambiguous way.

<gloss>
je  | ci | gi  | paŋ | dzað  | rʊ | paŋ | θe  | khɪtc
ɪɴᴅ | ᴀ  | the | it  | child | ᴘ  | it  | ᴘғᴠ | hurt
The child hurt itself.
</gloss>

## Plural and Uncountable Determiner Phrases

The complement in a determiner phrase may be uncountable or
[plural](./pluralization.md), in which case the entity identified by the
determiner phrase is a set or quantity.

<gloss>
je  | qa  | ðu  | me | rabʊm  | qa  | ðu  | lec   | can
ɪɴᴅ | ɢᴇɴ | ɢɴʀ | ᴘʟ | orange | ɢᴇɴ | ɢɴʀ | water | want
(I) want some oranges and some water.
</gloss>

In fact, Najan does not distinguish between countable and uncountable determiner
phrases since determiner phrases always identify discrete entities. In English,
"rock" is countable in "a small rock" but uncountable in "a hunk of rock". In
Najan, the word for "rock", {kut}, means "to be made of stone". Thus {za kut},
literally "a thing that is made of stone", could be translated into English
either as "a rock" (countable) or as "some rock" (uncountable).

## Ordering Determiner Phrases

We have to be careful about the order of [arguments](./arguments.md) when
distributive determiners and indefinite determiners are both present since they
are not commutative with each other.

It's true that every human has a human mother:

<gloss>
je  | qa  | su   | ðap   | ŋɪ  | za | ðap   | θaf
ɪɴᴅ | ɢᴇɴ | each | human | sʙᴊ | a  | human | mother
Every human is mothered by a human.
</gloss>

It is however not true that all humans share a single universal mother:

<gloss>
je  | ŋɪ  | za | ðap   | qa  | su   | ðap   | θaf
ɪɴᴅ | sʙᴊ | a  | human | ɢᴇɴ | each | human | mother
There is a human that is mother to every human.
</gloss>
