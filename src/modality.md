# Modality

Every clause in Najan begins with a mood particle expressing how the speaker
relates the clause to the world or to other possible worlds. The mood particles
are clipped from corresponding dynamic verbs, e.g. {je} (sensory indicative
mood) from {jec} (_sense_, _perceive_, or _intuit_).

## Indicative Moods

The indicative moods are used to assert a claim about how the world actually is.
These moods are distinguished by evidentiality, i.e. the speaker's source of
information supporting the claim.

The **sensory mood** (sɴs) is for claims supported by the speaker's own direct
sensory experience or intuition.

The **deductive mood** (ᴅᴇᴅ) is for conclusions the speaker has deduced
rationally from other accepted evidence. The conclusion could be based on sense
data, hearsay, or other inferences, as long as the conclusion itself comes from
the speaker's own reasoning. Use of the deductive mood doesn't imply that the
speaker has consciously constructed a formal logical proof for their claim, but
it should imply that they believe they could sketch a convincing informal
argument on request. Hunches should be expressed using the sensory mood, not the
deductive.

The **reportative mood** (ʀᴘʀᴛ) is for claims originating from someone other
than the speaker, such as something the speaker has heard or read.

The choice of indicative particle by itself has no bearing on how strongly the
speaker believes the claim. For instance, it's entirely possible to be more
convinced of a reportative statement originating from a highly reliable and
authoritative source than of a sensory statement based on a vague feeling or
unclear view. The speaker may convey how strongly they believe their own
statement using an epistemic mood particle.

## Interrogative Moods

The interrogative moods are for asking different types of questions.

A **content question** (ᴄᴏ̨) requests missing information using the
[interrogative pronoun](./pronouns.md) {vel}. The response should supply the
missing information that would make the complete clause true. To this
question...

<gloss>
gwɪ | ŋɪ  | vel  | qa  | to  | kʊv
ᴄᴏ̨  | sʙᴊ | what | ɢᴇɴ | you | names
What names you? (What is your name?)
</gloss>

...I could respond {je djan} (_It's Jon_).

Informally, one can omit {vel}, if it's apparent what's being asked: {gwi kʊv}
(_Name?_).

A content question may request multiple pieces of information.

<gloss>
gwɪ | tce | vel  | ci | vel | θe  | pɪn
ᴄᴏ̨  | ғɪɴ | what | ᴀ  | who | ᴘғᴠ | do
Who did what?
</gloss>

This questioner has asked for two pieces of information here: who did it and
what they did. Note that {vel} is a pronoun, so it can't stand in for a verb
directly. However, using {pɪn} (_do_) as the verb allows asking about actions,
by using {vel} as a causal-final argument.

A **polar question** (ᴘᴏ̨) prompts for a yes-or-no answer, confirming or denying
the clause.

<gloss>
ne | ci | to     | vɪg
ᴘᴏ̨ | ᴀ  | you-sɢ | go
Are you going?
</gloss>

The reponse can usually be very brief, e.g. {je ksi} (_it's true_) or {je gle}
(_it's false_).

An **alternative question** (ᴀᴏ̨) should pose a series of mutually exclusive
options, only one of which makes the overall clause true. Typically this
involves an exclusive logical disjunction. It's possible but very uncommon for
an alternative question to contain multiple sets of options, prompting multiple
selections from the respondent. A question with two opposite possibilities would
typically be expressed as a polar question but could be expressed as an
alternative question for emphassis: _are you or are you not my people?_

Any question may be predicated on faulty premises, whether implicit or explicit.
In that case, the respondent may choose to contradict these assumptions rather
than answer the question on its own terms.

## Deontic Moods

The deontic moods are for asserting how the world shall be or ought to be.

The **commissive mood** (ᴄᴍs) indicates that the speaker intends to bring about
the clause so that in the future it will be become or remain true.

The **imperative mood** (ɪᴍᴘᴇʀ) expresses a request or command for the listener
to make or keep the clause true.

The **volitive mood** (ᴠᴏʟ) expresses a wish or desire of the speaker. Unlike
the commissive or imperative moods, it does not imply that the speaker or
listener is responsible for actualizing that wish.

## Modal Clauses as Truth Propositions

It's possible to analyze clauses in any mood as corresponding to assertions
about what is actually true. Though this correspondence is most obvious for the
indicative moods, it's true for the others as well. For instance, a verb phrase
_X_ belonging to a clause in the volitive mood asserts the proposition that the
speaker wishes for _X_ to be true. Likewise, a clause in the polar interrogative
mood signifies that the speaker wonders whether _X_ is true and would like the
listener to provide an answer.

This kind of analysis is unusual but can be useful for correctly interpreting
logical operators or prepositional phrases applied to clauses. For example, {je
txa gleð} means _I sense that it is not raining_, whereas {txa je gleð} means _I
don't sense that it's raining_, which is a weaker claim. Similarly, {nʊ zʊm kca
vɪg} literally means _regretfully, I request that you go_, whereas {kca nʊ zʊm
vɪg} means _I request that you regretfully go_.
