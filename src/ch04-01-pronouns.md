# Pronouns

Najan has two first-person plural pronouns, distinguished by clusivity. The
inclusive pronoun <naj>djof</naj> ⟨djof⟩ includes the speaker, those addressed,
and possibly one or more third-person referents. The exclusive pronoun
<naj>jal</naj> ⟨jal⟩ includes the speaker and at least one third person but
excludes those addressed.

The assignable pronouns <naj>jom</naj> ⟨jom⟩, <naj>með</naj> ⟨með⟩,
<naj>paw</naj> ⟨paw⟩, and <naj>tsut</naj> ⟨tsut⟩ have no fixed properties (such
as person, number, or gender) and can be bound to any unquantified noun phrase
using determiners. Once all available pronouns have been assigned, subsequent
assignments must overwrite an existing assignment.

Quotations cannot affect the bindings of surrounding pronouns. Assignable
pronouns contained in a quotation may have completely different referents than
in the surrounding context or even none at all, when using a quotation to talk
about the pronouns themselves.

The interrogative pronoun <naj>velk</naj> ⟨velk⟩ stands for something unknown
and is essential to the formation of interrogative sentences, where it indicates
any missing information that the asker wishes to know.
