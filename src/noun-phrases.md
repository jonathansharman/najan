# Noun Phrases

Any verb phrase can also function as a noun phrase, signifying an abstract state
or action (e.g. _being human_, _running_, _love_). To talk about concrete
instances, sets, or amounts of something (e.g. _you_, _the victory_, _two dogs_,
_some water_, _several words_), we can use pronouns or determiner phrases.
