\section{Interjections} \label{sec:interjections}

Interjections have the same syntactic weight as complete sentences. In other
words, communication in Najan consists of a sequence of interjections and/or
complete sentences, and an interjection is never considered part of a sentence.

Four especially common interjections are \trans{azh} (``yes''), \trans{esh}
(``no''), \trans{odh} (``indeed'', ``right''), and \trans{ihth} (``to the
contrary'').
