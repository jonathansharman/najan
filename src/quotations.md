## Quotation

A quotation begins and ends with the particle <naj>tca</naj> ⟨tca⟩ and functions
as a noun signifying the contained words themselves. The particle <naj>tsa</naj>
⟨tsa⟩ is used within a quotation just before <naj>tca</naj> ⟨tca⟩ or another
<naj>tsa</naj> ⟨tsa⟩ to indicate that the second particle should be interpreted
as part of the quotation, not as a particle within the sentence containing the
quotation.

> **Note:** Determiner phrases within quotations cannot affect the bindings of
surrounding pronouns. Assignable pronouns contained in a quotation may have
completely different referents than in the surrounding context—or even none at
all, when using a quotation to talk about the pronouns themselves.
