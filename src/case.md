# Case

Najan marks case using prepositions, in both prepositional phrases acting as
[arguments](./arguments.md) to a verb and in [stativized verb
phrases](./stativization.md) using the particle {vʊ}.

| Case         | Gloss | Preposition |
| :----------- | :---- | :---------- |
| Subjective   | sʙᴊ   | {ŋɪ}        |
| Genitive     | ɢᴇɴ   | {qa}        |
| Agentive     | ᴀ     | {ci}        |
| Causal       | ᴄᴀᴜs  | {slo}       |
| Patientive   | ᴘ     | {rʊ}        |
| Instrumental | ɪɴs   | {θla}       |
| Partitive    | ᴘᴛᴠ   | {bo}        |
| Locative     | ʟᴏᴄ   | {lɪ}        |
| Lative       | ʟᴀᴛ   | {we}        |
| Ablative     | ᴀʙʟ   | {xun}       |
| Perlative    | ᴘᴇʀ   | {zij}       |
| Resultative  | ʀᴇs   | {tce}       |
| Identical    | ɪᴅᴇɴᴛ | {kʊv}       |
| Semblative   | sᴇᴍʙʟ | {kɪ}        |

Within a stative verb phrase, a **subject** (sʙᴊ) is something that is in that
state. A stative verb phrase may also take a genitive (ɢᴇɴ) argument, which
relates that argument to the subject according to the semantics of the verb. The
genitive preposition {qa} means "with respect to", "with regard to", or "in
relation to".

<gloss>
je  | qa  | vɪθ   | ŋɪ  | ko | zim
ɪɴᴅ | ɢᴇɴ | exist | sʙᴊ | I  | want
I want to exist.

The role of the genitive case in Najan is relatively narrow, reserved for
abstract relations where no other case applies. For example, the genitive is
distinct from the locative and partitive cases.

An **agent** (ᴀ) of a dynamic verb phrase is an animate, voluntary cause of the
action. A **patient** (ᴘ) is something that is acted upon or undergoes change as
a result of the action.

<gloss>
je  | ci | ko | rʊ | gi  | nʊ        | ganθ    | vʊ   | tce  | kwon    | θe   | fleh
ɪɴᴅ | ᴀ  | I  | ᴘ  | the | such-that | be-sand | sᴛᴀᴛ | ʀᴇs  | fortify | ᴘғᴠ  | destroy
I destroyed the sand castle (intentionally).
</gloss>

In contrast to an agent, a **cause** (ᴄᴀᴜs) is involuntary.

<gloss>
je  | slo  | ko | rʊ | gi  | nʊ        | ganθ    | vʊ   | tce | kwon    | θe  | fleh
ɪɴᴅ | ᴄᴀᴜs | I  | ᴘ  | the | such-that | be-sand | sᴛᴀᴛ | ʀᴇs | fortify | ᴘғᴠ | destroy
I destroyed the sand castle (unintentionally).
</gloss>

A cause can also be inanimate.

<gloss>
je  | slo  | gi  | vucul | rʊ | gi  | nʊ        | ganθ    | vʊ   | tce | kwon    | θe  | fleh
ɪɴᴅ | ᴄᴀᴜs | the | sea   | ᴘ  | the | such-that | be-sand | sᴛᴀᴛ | ʀᴇs | fortify | ᴘғᴠ | destroy
The sea destroyed the sand castle.
</gloss>

The **lative** (ʟᴀᴛ) case is used for any kind of action to or towards
something, in space or time.

<gloss>
je  | we   | to  | ci | ko | θe  | zen
ɪɴᴅ | ʟᴀᴛ  | you | ᴀ  | I  | ᴘғᴠ | give
I gave [it] to you.
</gloss>

The **semblative** (sᴇᴍʙʟ) case marks something the verb is similar to. The
semblative particle {kɪ} means "as", "like", or "in the manner of".

<gloss>
hon | kɪ    | ðu  | lec   | pɪf
ɢɴᴏ | sᴇᴍʙʟ | ɢɴʀ | water | soothe
[It] soothes like water.
