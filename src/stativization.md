# Stativization

The particles {vʊ} and {djʊ} can be used to form a new stative verb phrase from
another verb phrase. Stativization is especially useful when instantiating a
verbal noun via a [determiner phrase](./determiner-phrases.md).

Adding {vʊ} and a [case-marking preposition](./case.md) before a verb phrase
produces a new phrase meaning "to be a (case) with respect to (verb phrase)".

A doctor (healer) is an agent of healing:

<gloss>
{vʊ} | {ci} | {flej}
sᴛᴀᴛ | ᴀ    | to heal
to be a healer
</gloss>

A sword is an instrument of fencing:

<gloss>
{vʊ} | {θla} | {ces}
sᴛᴀᴛ | ɪɴs   | to fence (engage in swordplay)
to be a sword
</gloss>

A mother's child is an object of mothering:

<gloss>
{vʊ} | {qa} | {θaf}
sᴛᴀᴛ | ᴏʙᴊ  | to be a mother (to a child)
to be a child (of a mother)
</gloss>

The particle {djʊ} followed by a verb phrase means "to be an instance of (verb
phrase)".

A fire is an instance of burning:

<gloss>
{djʊ} | {tθoc}
sᴛᴀᴛ  | to burn
to be a fire
</gloss>

Somone's happiness is an instance of being happy:

<gloss>
{djʊ} | {tayn}
sᴛᴀᴛ  | to be happy
to be happiness
</gloss>
