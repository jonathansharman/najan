# Case

Each Najan case corresponds to a particular semantic role within the verb
phrase, marked using a preposition. These case prepositions are clipped from
corresponding stative verbs. For example, since {cim} means *agent*, the
corresponding case preposition {ci} marks the agentive case.

| Agentive     | ᴀ     | {ci}        | {cim}        |
| Causal       | ᴄᴀᴜs  | {slo}       | {slon}       |
| Patientive   | ᴘ     | {rʊ}        | {rʊk}        |
| Instrumental | ɪɴs   | {da}        | {dan}        |

| Resultative  | ʀᴇs   | {tce}       | {tceh}       |
| Identical    | ɪᴅᴇɴᴛ | {kʊ}        | {kʊv}        |
| Semblative   | sᴇᴍʙʟ | {kɪ}        | {kɪr}        |
| Comparative  | ᴄᴏᴍᴘ  | {ve}        | {vek}        |
| Locative     | ʟᴏᴄ   | {lɪ}        | {lɪf}        |
| Lative       | ʟᴀᴛ   | {we}        | {wef}        |
| Ablative     | ᴀʙʟ   | {xu}        | {xun}        |
| Perlative    | ᴘᴇʀ   | {zi}        | {zij}        |

Within a stative verb phrase, a **subject** (sʙᴊ) is something that is in that
state. Many stative verb phrases also permit a genitive (ɢᴇɴ) argument, which
relates that argument to the subject according to the particular semantics of
the verb. The genitive preposition {qa} means "with respect to", "with regard
to", or "in relation to".

<gloss>
je  | qa  | ŋɪ  | ko | ŋɪθ   | ŋɪ  | ko | zim
ɪɴᴅ | ɢᴇɴ | sʙᴊ | I  | exist | sʙᴊ | I  | want
I want to exist. (I want that I exist.)
</gloss>

An **agent** (ᴀ) of a dynamic verb phrase is an animate, voluntary cause of the
action. A **patient** (ᴘ) is something that is acted upon or undergoes change as
a result of the action.

<gloss>
je  | ci | ko | rʊ | gi  | nʊ        | ganθ    | qa  | kwon    | tceh   | θe  | fleh
ɪɴᴅ | ᴀ  | I  | ᴘ  | the | such-that | be-sand | ɢᴇɴ | fortify | result | ᴘғᴠ | destroy
I destroyed the sand castle (intentionally).
</gloss>

In contrast to an agent, a **cause** (ᴄᴀᴜs) is involuntary.

<gloss>
je  | slo  | ko | rʊ | gi  | nʊ        | ganθ    | qa  | kwon    | tceh   | θe  | fleh
ɪɴᴅ | ᴄᴀᴜs | I  | ᴘ  | the | such-that | be-sand | ɢᴇɴ | fortify | result | ᴘғᴠ | destroy
I destroyed the sand castle (unintentionally).
</gloss>

A cause can also be inanimate.

<gloss>
je  | slo  | gi  | vucul | rʊ | gi  | nʊ        | ganθ    | qa  | kwon    | tceh   | θe  | fleh
ɪɴᴅ | ᴄᴀᴜs | the | sea   | ᴘ  | the | such-that | be-sand | ɢᴇɴ | fortify | result | ᴘғᴠ | destroy
The sea destroyed the sand castle.
</gloss>

The **semblative** (sᴇᴍʙʟ) case marks something the verb is similar to. The
semblative particle {kɪ} means "as", "like", or "in the manner of".

<gloss>
hon | kɪ    | ðu  | lec   | pɪf
ɢɴᴏ | sᴇᴍʙʟ | ɢɴʀ | water | soothe
[It] soothes like water.
</gloss>

The **comparative** (ᴄᴏᴍᴘ) case marks a point of comparison or reference, within
a stative verb phrase of degree.

<gloss>
je  | ve   | to  | ŋɪ  | ko | ruθ
ɪɴᴅ | ᴄᴏᴍᴘ | you | sʙᴊ | I  | small
I am smaller than you. (I am small in comparison to you.)
</gloss>

The comparative particle {ve} means roughly *than* or *in comparison to*, but
unlike these English terms, the comparison is always against the subject of the
verb. This avoids ambiguous comparisons such as *I like cheesecake more than
you*---*more than you like cheesecake* or *more than I like you*?

A comparative argument can be combined with the [distributive
determiner](./determiner-phrases.md) {su} to form a superlative:

<gloss>
je  | ve   | su   | tez   | ŋɪ  | ko | ruθ
ɪɴᴅ | ᴄᴏᴍᴘ | each | other | sʙᴊ | I  | small
I am the smallest. (I am small in comparison to all others.)
</gloss>

## Spatio-temporal Cases

Najan has four cases for characterizing a verb's place and time. The
**locative** (ʟᴏᴄ) particle {lɪ} marks being or occurring at or within a point
or region of space or time. The **lative** (ʟᴀᴛ) {we} indicates direction to or
into a point or region, while its inverse, the **ablative** (ᴀʙʟ) {xu},
indicates from, away from, or out of. Finally, the **perlative** (ᴘᴇʀ) {zi}
indicates movement (again, in space or time) through, throughout, or across.
Each of these prepositions is inclusive: {we} includes the destination; {xu}
includes the origin; and {zi} includes the entirety of the path, region, or
duration.

The objects of these case prepositions may be explicit places or times, but they
could also be something else, such as a person or event. In that case, the
argument refers to the spatio-temporal location of that object; e.g. {lɪ ko}
(literally "at me") means "at my time and place".

English supplies a plethora of prepositions for describing spatio-temporal
relations. For instance, a chair may be at, on, under, or beside a table. In
Najan, each of these relations would use the locative case: {za lɪ za cats qa
muð dan}, "a chair at a table".

The case marker alone is often sufficient in context to convey the full
relationship, but to add clarity or expressiveness, one can replace the object
of the case preposition with a more specific expression. For example, since the
lative case particle {we} ("to") is always inclusive of the specified
destination, {we gi vatθ} ("to the end") means that the verb phrase holds true
up to and including the end. To convey that the verb phrase held true up to (but
not necessarily including) some time before the end, one could say {we za qa gi
vatθ kle}, lit. "to a past [time] of the end".
