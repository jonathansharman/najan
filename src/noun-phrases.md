# Noun Phrases

Any stative verb phrase can also function as a noun phrase, signifying that
state in the abstract (e.g. "being human", "love"). To talk about concrete
instances, sets, or amounts of something (e.g. "you", "my dogs", "some water",
"several words"), we can use pronouns or determiner phrases.
