# Case

Prepositions are also used to mark case, with the complement of the preposition
serving a particular semantic role within the expression. These case
prepositions are clipped from corresponding stative verbs. For example, since
{cim} means _agent_, the corresponding case preposition {ci} marks the agentive
case.

| Locative     | ʟᴏᴄ   | {lɪ}        | {lɪf}        |
| Lative       | ʟᴀᴛ   | {we}        | {wef}        |

Within a stative verb phrase, a **subject** (sʙᴊ) is something that is in that
state. Many verbs (including some dynamic verbs) also permit a **genitive**
(ɢᴇɴ) argument, which expresses some relation according to the particular
semantics of the verb. The genitive preposition {qa} means _with respect to_,
_with regard to_, or _in relation to_. For example, the genitive argument of the
stative verb {zim} (_want_) is that which is wanted.

<gloss>
je  | qa  | ŋɪ  | ko | ŋɪθ   | ŋɪ  | ko | zim
sɴs | ɢᴇɴ | sʙᴊ | I  | exist | sʙᴊ | I  | want
I want to exist. (I want that I exist.)
</gloss>

The **semblative** (sᴇᴍʙʟ) case marks something the complement is similar to.
The semblative particle {kɪ} means _as_, _like_, or _in the manner of_.

<gloss>
hon | kɪ    | ðu  | lec   | pɪf
ɢɴᴏ | sᴇᴍʙʟ | ɢɴʀ | water | soothe
[It] soothes like water.
</gloss>

The **comparative** (ᴄᴏᴍᴘ) case marks a point of comparison or reference within
a stative verb phrase of degree.

<gloss>
je  | ve   | to  | ŋɪ  | ko | ruθ
sɴs | ᴄᴏᴍᴘ | you | sʙᴊ | I  | small
I am smaller than you. (I am small in comparison to you.)
</gloss>

The comparative particle {ve} means roughly _than_ or _in comparison to_, but
unlike these English terms, the comparison is always against the subject of the
verb. This avoids ambiguous comparisons such as _I like cheesecake more than
you_---_more than you like cheesecake_ or _more than I like you_?

A comparative argument can be combined with the [distributive
determiner](./determiner-phrases.md) {su} to form a superlative:

<gloss>
je  | ve   | su   | tez   | ŋɪ  | ko | ruθ
sɴs | ᴄᴏᴍᴘ | each | other | sʙᴊ | I  | small
I am the smallest. (I am small in comparison to all others.)
</gloss>
