# Introduction

This book describes the major phonological, orthographic, syntactic, and
semantic properties of Najan, my first and only conlang. Najan is an *a priori*,
analytic, isolating conlang with mostly phonemic orthography, unambiguous
context-free syntax, and features from first-order logic.

I have no formal linguistic training, so the language is not very naturalistic
or elaborate as far as conlangs go. Nevertheless, it's been a joy to work on,
and I'm happy with how it has evolved and excited to share it with others.

*Soli Deo gloria.*
