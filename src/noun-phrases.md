# Noun Phrases

Any verb phrase can also function as a noun phrase, signifying an abstract state
or action (e.g. *being human*, *running*, *love*). To talk about concrete
instances, sets, or amounts of something (e.g. *you*, *the victory*, *two dogs*,
*some water*, *several words*), we can use pronouns or determiner phrases.
