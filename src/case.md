# Case

Najan marks case using prepositions, in both prepositional phrases acting as
[arguments](./arguments.md) to a verb and in [stativized verb
phrases](./stativization.md) using the particle {vʊ}.

## Case Prepositions

| Case       | Gloss  | Preposition |
| :--------- | :----- | :---------- |
| Subject    | (sʙᴊ)  | {ŋɪ}        |
| Object     | (ᴏʙᴊ)  | {qa}        |
| Agent      | (ᴀ)    | {ci}        |
| Cause      | (ᴄᴀᴜs) | {slo}       |
| Patient    | (ᴘ)    | {rʊ}        |
| Instrument | (ɪɴs)  | {θla}       |
| Dative     | (ᴅᴀᴛ)  | {ðu}        |

kɪ	preposition	as (manner)	marks adverbial case
tce	preposition	resulting in (result); producing (product)	marks resultative case
kʊv	preposition	identified as; named	marks identical case?
(ʟᴏᴄ) lɪ	preposition	in, within (region of space or period of time); at (point in space or time)	marks locative case

Within a stative verb phrase, a **subject** (sʙᴊ) is something that is in the
state described by the verb, and an **object** (ᴏʙᴊ) is a catch-all argument
that relates to the subject according to the particular semantics of the verb.
The object-marking preposition {qa} could be translated as "with respect to".

je  | qa  | to  | ŋɪ  | ko | gwi
ɪɴᴅ | ᴏʙᴊ | you | sʙᴊ | I  | be-behind
I am behind you.

TODO: two-subject example, e.g. this equals that (this and that are both subjects)

An **agent** (ᴀ) of a dynamic verb phrase is an animate, voluntary cause of the
action. A **patient** (ᴘ) is something that is acted upon or undergoes change as
a result of the action.

<gloss>
ci | ko | rʊ | gi  | nʊ        | ganθ    | vʊ   | lɪ   | kwon    | θe   | fleh
ᴀ  | I  | ᴘ  | the | such-that | be-sand | sᴛᴀᴛ | ʟᴏᴄ  | fortify | ᴘғᴠ  | destroy
I destroyed the sand castle (intentionally).
</gloss>

In contrast to an agent, a **cause** (ᴄᴀᴜs) is involuntary.

<gloss>
slo  | ko | rʊ | gi  | nʊ        | ganθ    | vʊ   | lɪ  | kwon    | θe  | fleh
ᴄᴀᴜs | I  | ᴘ  | the | such-that | be-sand | sᴛᴀᴛ | ʟᴏᴄ | fortify | ᴘғᴠ | destroy
I destroyed the sand castle (unintentionally).
</gloss>

A cause can also be inanimate.

<gloss>
slo  | gi  | vucul | rʊ | gi  | nʊ        | ganθ    | vʊ   | lɪ  | kwon    | θe  | fleh
ᴄᴀᴜs | the | sea   | ᴘ  | the | such-that | be-sand | sᴛᴀᴛ | ʟᴏᴄ | fortify | ᴘғᴠ | destroy
The sea destroyed the sand castle.
