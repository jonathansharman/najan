# Tense & Aspect

Tense specifies _when_ along a timeline a verb phrase occurs (e.g. past,
present, future), whereas aspect characterizes _how_ the verb phrase extends
over time. In Najan, aspect is marked syntactically with a (possibly null)
particle immediately preceding the verb or verb phrase. In contrast, tense has
no direct syntactic representation, so it must be marked explicitly with
[temporal arguments](./time-and-place.md), [inferred from the
surrounding context](./tense-aspect.md#inferring-tense-from-context), or else
assumed from the verb's aspect.

| Aspect     | Gloss | Particle |
| :--------- | :---- | :------- |
| Continuous | ᴄᴏɴᴛ  | ---      |
| Perfective | ᴘғᴠ   | {θe}     |
| Inchoative | ɪɴᴄʜ  | {dje}    |
| Cessative  | ᴄᴇss  | {vat}    |
| Habitual   | ʜᴀʙ   | {fxe}    |
| Gnomic     | ɢɴᴏ   | {hon}    |

The **continuous** (ᴄᴏɴᴛ) aspect views a verb as ongoing or in progress. It is
the default aspect, in the absence of an aspect particle. Without temporal
arguments or additional context, a continuous verb phrase may be assumed to be
in present tense. Najan does not distinguish between continuous and progressive
aspects.

The **perfective** (ᴘғᴠ) aspect views a verb in its entirety, as a complete
action or state. Without other clues, a perfective verb phrase is most likely to
be in past tense. For example, {je ci ko θe tcet} is more likely to mean _I ate_
(simple past) or _I have eaten_ (past perfect) than _I will eat_ (simple
future).

The **inchoative** (ɪɴᴄʜ) aspect views a verb as beginning, as in {je dje sic},
_[he] starts to cry_. Inversely, the **cessative** (ᴄᴇss) aspect views a verb as
ending: {je vat sic}, _[he] stops crying_. By default, verbs in these aspects
are in present tense.

The **habitual** (ʜᴀʙ) aspect views a verb as occurring regularly over some
period of time, centered on the present by default. If {je ci to vɪg} is in
present tense, it means _you are going_, and the corresponding habitual phrase,
{je ci to fxe vɪg}, means _you go [regularly]_. If we instead assume past tense,
then they translate respectively to _you were going_ and either _you would go_
or _you used to go_.

The **gnomic** (ɢɴᴏ) aspect views a verb as a general truth with little or no
temporal structure. As such, the concept of tense is usually inapplicable.
Gnomic verb phrases often feature generic [determiner
phrases](./determiner-phrases.md) as arguments and express an aphorism, a
mathematical truth, etc.

<gloss>
ŋo  | ŋɪ  | ðu  | zʊn | ve   | ðu  | djʊr | hon | dzul
ᴅᴇᴅ | sʙᴊ | ɢɴʀ | two | than | ɢɴʀ | one  | ɢɴᴏ | is large
Two is greater than one. (Things of size two are greater than things of size one.)
</gloss>

The gnomic verb phrase above expresses a general mathematical fact. If it were
written in the continuous aspect instead (without {hon}), it would leave open
the possibility that two might not have always been or might not always be
greater than one.

## Inferring Tense from Context

As described above, aspect markers can also carry a small amount of tense
information. For example, perfective aspect often implies past tense. However,
these associations are secondary to context. Suppose a speaker first says:

<gloss>
lay | lɪ | ŋodl     | ŋɪ  | ko | θe  | vɪg
ᴄᴍs | at | tomorrow | sʙᴊ | I  | ᴘғᴠ | go
I will go tomorrow.
</gloss>

By using the preposition {lɪ}, the speaker has established a context in the
future. Suppose the speaker then says {je ci ko θe tɪz}. In isolation, since
this sentence is in perfective aspect, one might interpret it as _I have spoken_
(present perfect) or _I spoke_ (simple past). However, since future tense has
already been established, one should instead translate the second clause as _I
will speak_ or _I will have spoken_ (sometime tomorrow, after having gone).
